 <h3>What is upcycling?</h3>
<p>Upcycling, also known as creative reuse, is the process of transforming by-products, waste materials, useless, or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality and environmental value.</p>

<h3>Make it Magical on upcycling</h3>
<p>We love upcycling and restoring the dignity of throwaways by giving them a new purpose. We do our best to re-use, reduce, and recycle and all of our elf,gnome and fairy cottages are made from items that would usually end up in the trash and all of our foraged products can be substituted by local treasures found in any park or wooded area. </p>
