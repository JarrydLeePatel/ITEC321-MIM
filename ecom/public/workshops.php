    <p>What to expect at a Make it Magical Workshop.

Each participant gets to select their preferred base structure. This is simply an empty plastic bottle; cleaned, cut and recycled to represent a little house; each with a roof and a little door.

The bottle is set on a supawood base with ample space for landscaping and decorating.

Each workspace has a share tray of artificial moss, natural moss, bark, fairy flowers, fairy fencing and a tub of fairy sparkles and embellishments.

Also on the table – fairy grass, fairy gravel and our special quick set wood glue. </p>

<p>In addition, we have a paint station with a variety of colours to suit all tastes.

Our very popular forage trays are filled with a variety of sticks, twigs, stones, shells, log slices and all the weird and wonderful woodland treasures that nature provides. </p>

<p>The hugely popular hot glue station is where the action happens. Participants are encouraged to let their imagination run wild. We bring a variety of accessories that can be turned into chairs, tables, swings, trees, ponds, fountains and anything else that you can think of. Anything is possible with a bit of hot glue!

The hot glue station is manned by our fairy helpers and we remind parents and children to keep their fingers away from the hot glue. We provide additional hot glue guns so that parents and children who are familiar with this tool are free to create without supervision. Additional tools include a drill, junior hacksaw, secateurs and smaller tools for finer details. It’s not uncommon for fairy moms and dads to have fun at the hot glue station. </p>
